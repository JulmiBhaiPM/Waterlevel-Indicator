# 💧 Water Level Indicator

An **Arduino-based water level indicator** project to monitor and display the level of water in a tank using sensors and visual/audible alerts.

---

## 📘 Overview  
This project uses a sensor (e.g. ultrasonic, float, or other) to measure water level inside a tank. The Arduino reads the sensor data and displays or signals the water level. It helps in automating alerts or actions when water is low or full.

---

## ⚙️ Components Used  
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- Water level sensor (e.g. ultrasonic / float / pressure sensor)  
- LCD / LED / Buzzer / Indicator (for displaying level)  
- Power supply / battery  
- Wires, resistors, supporting circuit components  

---

## 🧠 How It Works  
1. The sensor measures the distance or level of water.  
2. Arduino converts sensor readings to meaningful water-level data.  
3. Based on threshold values, the system triggers indicators (LEDs, buzzer) or displays the level.  
4. Optionally, further expansion (motor control, pump) can be added.
